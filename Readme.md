# Sobel Filter Project

This project includes the implementation of a Sobel filter for edge detection in images, designed using VHDL. It also contains filtered and original image sets, along with supporting documentation and visual resources.

## Project Structure
- **Filtered Files Folder**: Contains files that have been processed using the Sobel filter.
- **Filtered Images Folder**: Contains images that have been processed using the Sobel filter.
- **Original Files Folder**: Contains the original unprocessed files.
- **Original Images Folder**: Contains the original unprocessed images.
- **Report Folder**: This folder contains the full documentation of the project.
- **Sobel Filter Designed by VHDL Folder**: Contains the VHDL code for the Sobel filter design.
- **Visio Folder**: Contains diagrams representing the Sobel filter design, created using Microsoft Visio.

## Features
- Implements the Sobel filter using VHDL for edge detection.
- Includes both original and filtered images and files for comparison.
- Provides detailed project documentation explaining the filter’s design and implementation.
- Includes Visio diagrams for a clear visual representation of the Sobel filter’s structure and processes.

## Requirements
- **VHDL Compiler**: Required for compiling and testing the Sobel filter VHDL code.
- **Image Viewer**: To view the original and filtered images.
- **Microsoft Visio** (optional): To view and edit the graphical diagrams in the Visio folder.

## How to Run
1. Compile the VHDL code found in the **Sobel Filter Designed by VHDL** folder.
2. Review the **Filtered Files** and **Filtered Images** folders to observe the Sobel filter's output.
3. Refer to the **Report** folder for detailed information on the filter’s architecture and usage.
4. Use **Visio** to visualize the Sobel filter’s design using the provided diagrams in the **Visio** folder.
5. Compare the results with the **Original Files** and **Original Images** folders.

## Visualization
The Visio diagrams provide a clear and detailed view of the Sobel filter’s design, helping to understand how edge detection is applied through the filter.
